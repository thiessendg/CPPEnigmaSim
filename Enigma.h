    There were several rotors and reflectors to choose between.  The exact rotation-point of individual rotors was controlled by rings.
    The M4 Enigma (u-boats) was basically a M3 Enigma with a special two-part reflector.  This configurable reflector made for
    a dramatic increase in keyspace. */
